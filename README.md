# Feature-Pyramid-Recurrent-Residual-U-Net-for-Metallographic-Image-Segmentation
In this repository a novel U-Net architecture s being proposed which contains Feature Pyramid in the decoder part and has recurrent residual block along with squeeze and excitation channel for efficient feature extraction.
